# Dijkstra's algorithm

The Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm used in graph theory to find the shortest path from a node to another. It is notably use in the industry to calculate fastest route (Google Maps, Waze...) or to solve complex situation.

The goal of this project is to provide student with an online tool to graphicaly create graph, and - using the Dijkstra's algorithm - find the fasted way from a node to another. Then provide the user with an animated image of the process.
